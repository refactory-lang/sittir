# Compiler-Simplification — Master Plan (execution index)

> **For agentic workers:** This is the **orchestration index** above the per-PR plans. It does NOT
> restate the design — the spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-compiler-simplification-design.md`
> §5 owns the *why* and the per-PR change-set. This doc owns the **execution view**: dependency graph,
> concurrency waves, branch names, status, and the last gate result per PR. Each PR gets its own
> bite-sized plan (via superpowers:writing-plans) when it's picked up; execute it via
> superpowers:subagent-driven-development.

**Goal:** Execute the 16 pending PRs of the compiler-simplification strangler without regressing native pass-rates, tracking dependencies + safe concurrency across sessions.

**Architecture:** Strangler — build the Model beside the old pipeline, migrate one concern per PR, gate every step on `pnpm validate:native`. Each PR removes the code it supersedes within the same PR.

**Source of truth:** spec §5 (PR change-sets), §7 (end-state inventory). This index is derived from them.

## Execution rules (apply to every PR)

- **Branch off `origin/master`, NOT off `029`.** `029` was reset-to-`origin/master` + re-cherry-picked twice already, dropping committed work. Implementation PRs must not ride a churning feature branch. (The spec/plans docs themselves live on `029` per the user; *code* PRs branch off master.)
- **Gate: `pnpm validate:native`** for all 3 grammars — NOT raw `counts --backend native` (a stale `.node` silently falls back to the TS path and masks regressions; `validate:native` rebuilds first). See `project_native_build_and_staleness`.
- **Rust-emitting PRs also run an independent `cargo check --workspace --features napi-bindings` + re-count** — the SubagentStop gate no-ops after a regen, so cargo-verify is a manual step (`feedback_verify_cargo_not_gate`). Rust-emitting set: **PR-D, PR-E, PR-I, PR-M, PR-P, PR-Q**.
- **Symbol renames / non-trivial structural refactors → execute via the copilot CLI** (it has LSP read/WRITE; Claude Code's LSP is effectively read-only). Prep the target skeleton, then let copilot run the LSP rename-symbol / move-file — NOT hand text-edits (which miss re-exports, aliased imports, JSDoc `{@link}`, type-only imports). Rename-heavy PRs: **PR-B** (`AssembledNonterminal` interface→class), **PR-H** (`optimize.ts`→`normalize.ts` + the `#14` method renames), **PR-P** (`node`→`kind`). See `feedback_use_ts_lsp_for_moves`.
- **Baseline (2026-05-25, re-measure at each PR start):** the headline is `origin/master`-accurate — **rust cov 181/186 · read-render-parse 134/136 · ast 125 · python 107/110 · 96/115 · ast 74 · ts 174/182 · 82/111 · ast 75**. If the implementation base carries 029's applied `type_arguments`/`type_parameters` groups (`fc7c77de`), rust is `182/186 · ast 126`. **PR-A's Task 0 settles this empirically** before any code change.

- **Critical path:** `A → B → C → D → D2 → {E,F} → H → M → I → (K) → L`. This is the spine; everything else hangs off it.
- **PR-M ≺ PR-I is a hard gate** (M restructures the Model into `AssembledBranch`; I is the emitter rewrite that consumes it).
- **PR-Q ≺ requires PR-P** (P establishes the flat enum predicate; Q switches it to recursive).
- **PR-L is strictly last** — it depends on M/I (the retype removal + discriminating-slot model), N (residue shrink), and G (the gate).

## Concurrency annotation — graph for planning, conservative on execution

The linear order over-serializes. The graph reveals genuine independence — but **physical parallelism is only safe where PRs touch disjoint files AND can be gated independently**, because `validate:native` is a *global* gate (regen rebuilds the whole `.node`), so two concurrent PRs touching the model/emitters make a regression impossible to attribute. Each PR below is flagged for whether it's truly disjoint.

**Safe to run in parallel:**
1. **PR-G alongside the `A→B→C→D` core.** Additive infrastructure — new files `compiler/diagnostics.ts` + `compiler/emit-gate.ts` + one wire-in to `generate.ts`; no severity is `fail` until PR-L. File-disjoint from the naming/emitter core. (Constraint: must land before PR-H, which threads G's sink into the contexts.)
2. **PR-E ‖ PR-F** (wave 5). Disjoint emitter file-sets — E = transport-projection + render-module (+ `bridge.rs` delete); F = factory + from + types. Both read the same slot-class getters (built by B/C/D) but write different outputs; each gates on counts independently. The clearest concurrent pair.

**Parallel-with-caution (off critical path, but re-gate carefully):**
3. **PR-N (enrich-widening)** is enrich/wire-side and independent of the emitter chain, but it *changes which slots are named* (shrinks the `inferred` set), which ripples into the model + counts. Can overlap the `M→I→K` chain on its own branch, but re-measure on rebase.

**Keep serial (high file-overlap despite logical independence):**
4. **PR-O (structural de-dup)** is non-behavioral, but `MO2` edits `NodeRef`/`TerminalValue` in `node-map.ts` and `M1` relocates shared transforms into `transforms.ts` — both heavily touched by the core + PR-H. Run it *after* the value model (B) and `transforms.ts` (H) settle, serially, to avoid churn conflicts.
5. **PR-P → PR-Q** are sequential and rust-emitting; keep them serial and off the polymorph chain (they only need PR-H's `optimize.ts`→`normalize.ts` rename to have landed).

**Net:** at most ~2 active branches at once is realistic and safe (e.g. core-spine + PR-G early; then E ‖ F). Don't fan out wider — the global gate and shared `node-map.ts`/emitter surface make broader parallelism net-negative.

## How to advance this plan

1. Pick the next ⬜ PR whose `depends-on` are all ✅.
2. Branch `<branch-name>` off `origin/master`; write its per-PR plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<pr>.md`) via writing-plans.
3. Execute via subagent-driven-development; gate on `pnpm validate:native` (+ cargo-verify if rust-emitting).
4. On merge: update this row's Status to ✅ + record the last gate numbers, and link the per-PR plan.

**Done so far:** PR-A (#40) → PR-B (#41) → PR-C (#43, +#44 unified-CLI) → **PR-D (#45)** → **PR-D2 (#46)** → **PR-F (#47)** → **PR-E2 (#48)** all merged, + the **PR-E band-aid cleanup** (delete dead band-aid 1, relabel load-bearing band-aid 2; byte-neutral). The `$with` variadic criterion is **deferred** to the single end-of-plan type-error cleanup pass (generated-code type errors are not gated mid-plan — `validate:native` render/parse is the gate). Gate held at **rust ast 125 · ts ast 72 · python ast 76** through all of it.

**PR-E learning (`project_pr_e_spec_premises_false`):** PR-E's original row ("read class + delete 2 band-aids + delete bridge.rs") was **false on every premise** — read-class was already wired (FOLD-1 present), band-aid 2 is **load-bearing** (removing it regresses `type_arguments` jinja), and `bridge.rs` had a **live caller** (a coordinated sunset, not dead-code delete). It dissolved into: PR-E2 (bridge sunset, done) + the band-aid cleanup (done) + nothing for "read class" (already done). **Lesson: isolation-test "this is removable" claims (delete→regen→diff), never trust a static probe or a "temporary"/"band-aid" comment.**

**Up next: PR-G** (`pr-g-diagnostics-gate` — additive diagnostics severity model + Assemble→Project gate; must land before PR-H) then the spine resumes **PR-H → PR-M → PR-I → PR-K → … → PR-L**. Baseline to carry forward: **rust ast 125 · ts ast 72 · python ast 76** (native, deep read-render-parse).
