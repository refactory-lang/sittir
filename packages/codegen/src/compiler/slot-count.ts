/**
 * compiler/slot-count.ts — shared recursive slot counter.
 *
 * Mirrors `collectSlots`' distribution semantics, built on
 * `isNonterminalRuleType` from rule-catalog.ts (Table 1). This is the
 * single source of truth for "how many slots does this rule contribute."
 *
 * Distribution table (matches the spec design doc):
 *
 *   seq                       → recurse + sum members (distribute)
 *   choice / symbol / supertype /
 *   pattern / enum / repeat /
 *   repeat1 / optional / field → 1 (slot boundary — one union/array/single slot)
 *   variant / group / clause   → transparent — recurse into content
 *   string / terminal /
 *   indent / dedent / newline  → 0
 *
 * Note: `choice`, `repeat`, `repeat1`, `optional`, and `field` each count as
 * exactly ONE slot regardless of their contents — they are slot BOUNDARIES, not
 * transparent containers. A seq distributes across its members because seqs
 * themselves emit no slot.
 *
 * `variant` / `group` / `clause` are transparent because they are purely
 * structural wrappers; their content's slot count IS this node's slot count.
