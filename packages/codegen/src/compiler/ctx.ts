/**
 * compiler/ctx.ts — the per-phase pipeline context hierarchy.
 *
 * ONE ctx class per phase (EvaluateCtx, LinkCtx, NormalizeCtx, SimplifyCtx,
 * AssembleCtx), each extending `BaseCtx`. `BaseCtx` holds the read-only grammar
 * facts every phase derives once (rules, the grammar word-shape predicate,
 * diagnostics, the inline set, the rule-construction strategy). Subclasses add
 * phase-specific inputs and — only where a phase genuinely accumulates — a
 * mutation API as methods (never a bare mutable field handed to every caller).
 *
 * Discipline:
 *   - Immutable inputs are `readonly` (+ `ReadonlyMap`/`ReadonlySet`/`readonly[]`).
 *   - A function that must NOT mutate takes a `Readonly<XCtx>` / narrowed view;
 *     the caller still passes the one ctx object.
 *   - Pass-local state (seen sets, per-rule `name`) stays an explicit trailing
 *     parameter — NOT on the ctx (Principle #14 / CW6).
 *
 * Layering: this lives in `compiler/` (phase-pipeline concern). The `builder`
 * field is typed from `dsl/` (`RuleBuilder`) — `compiler → dsl`, the allowed
 * direction. The dsl transform helpers that need a builder take a structural
 * `{ builder?: RuleBuilder }` slice, NOT this class, so no `dsl → compiler` cycle.

 * `BaseCtx<RenderRule>` (simplify) → `BaseCtx<SimplifiedRule>` (assemble).
