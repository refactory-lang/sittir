 * 'override-authored-or-replaced'→'override', 'evaluate-synthesized'→
 * 'evaluate'). That migration is NOT done here: `compiler/generate.ts`'s
 * `collectEvaluateSynthesizedKinds` reads
 * `RuleCatalogEntry.provenance === 'evaluate-synthesized'` and BRANCHES ON IT
 * to decide which kinds get factory/wrap emission skipped
 * (`emitters/shared.ts`'s `synthesizedKinds?.has(kind)` skip-gate) — a
 * genuine compiler-behavior read. `generate.ts` is not a sanctioned reader of
 * the opaque `RuleMetadata` bag (sanctioned set: dsl/enrich, dsl/wire incl.
 * transform machinery, diagnostics-emission code — see
 * `dsl/rule-metadata.ts`'s header). Moving this fact into `metadata.author`
 * would force that read through the restricted `readRuleMetadata` from a
 * non-sanctioned compiler file, which is exactly the doctrine violation
 * decision 3 forbids. Per decision 6's own instruction ("if a compiler-side
 * consumer BRANCHES ON IT for behavior, STOP and report"): `RuleProvenance`
 * stays a separate, already-well-layered, non-opaque, structurally-typed
 * field on `RuleCatalogEntry` (set once at rule-catalog construction time,
 * never stamped-then-reread) — it is a DIFFERENT, correctly-single-sourced
 * mechanism from the `metadata.source` / `FieldRule.source` / `SymbolRule.
 * source` homonym family decision 6 actually targets (see this research

	 *
	 * PR-137 narrowed this to its JUSTIFIED-EXCEPTION consumers; the PR-137
	 * follow-on-3 migration (2026-07-05) closed out the LAST render/derivation
	 * consumer — `compiler/assemble.ts`'s hidden-body/subtype-resolution
	 * family (`resolveHiddenSubtypes` / `includeAliasMemberKinds` /
	 * `isAliasMemberKind` / `isCompatibleSubtypeMember` /
	 * `resolveHiddenRuleContent`) now reads `AssembleCtx.normalizedRules`
	 * instead, with the former "no REPEAT1 case = opaque" switch behavior
	 * translated into explicit `multiplicity`/`fieldName`/`aliasedFrom`
	 * attribute checks run BEFORE the type switch (see
	 * `resolveHiddenRuleContent`'s doc comment in assemble.ts for the full
	 * translation table and the regression fixture this closes — rust's
	 * `_delim_tokens` supertype chain resolving `%` as a bogus subtype and
	 * crashing `emitSupertypeUnionDeclarations`). `AssembleCtx.linkRules` (the
	 * getter this family used to read) is DELETED — zero assemble consumers
	 * remain. The PR-137 follow-on-4 investigation (same day) tried migrating
	 * this family from `AssembleCtx.normalizedRules` to `AssembleCtx.rules`
	 * (`SimplifiedGrammar`'s own phase product — the map `assemble()`'s input
	 * container is actually named for, so `normalizedRules` wasn't obviously
	 * justified over it) and found it EMPIRICALLY UNSAFE: python's
	 * `_simple_pattern` supertype loses its `_simple_pattern_negative` subtype
	 * entry under `rules` (simplify's SEQ-collapse unmasks an intentionally
	 * opaque SEQ shape into a dispatchable CHOICE, discarding the variant-
	 * adopted kind's own name) — see `AssembleCtx`'s class doc comment for the
	 * full root-cause. The family stays on `normalizedRules`; the getter is
	 * NOT deleted. `topLevelAliasBodies` stays a distinct field (its presence
	 * test — "is this hidden kind an alias-mint target" — has no rule-
	 * attribute equivalent; its VALUES are redundant with `normalizedRules[name]`
	 * and no longer read directly).
	 *
	 * The word-matcher consumer came OFF this list in the PR-137 follow-on: it
	 * no longer compiles from `linkRules` (or any post-link view) at all —
	 * it's pinned once at Link time from `raw.rules` and carried on
	 * `wordMatcher` (below) instead. Remaining consumers are exclusively the
	 * two BY-DESIGN authoring-shape diagnostics (not render/derivation paths —
	 * see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-grammar-phase-ctx-design.md's
	 * end-state table, row "emitters"):
	 *   - `emitters/suggested.ts`'s `findSymbolPosition` (via `parentRule`)
	 *     and `detectGroupCandidates`/`walkBodyForGroups` (via `groupRules`):
	 *     both explicitly pattern-match `FIELD`/`OPTIONAL`/`REPEAT`/
	 *     `REPEAT1`/`ALIAS`/`TOKEN`/`VARIANT`/`GROUP` wrapper shapes by
	 *     design — these are propose-diagnostics over the grammar's
	 *     natural (pre-wrapper-deletion) authoring shape, not render
	 *     consumers.
	 *   - `compiler/link.ts`'s `resolveRefinePath`/`narrowedFieldLiteralsForForm`
	 *     (via `emitters/refine-emit.ts`'s `collectRefineKindInfos`):
	 *     `refine()` selection paths are authored against the pre-normalize
	 *     tree, so path resolution must walk the same wrapper shapes.
