/**
 * grammar-twin.ts — recursive, schema-threaded twins of tree-sitter's
 * `RuleBuilder` / `Grammar`, plus a depth-bounded symbol `Resolve`.
 *
 * tree-sitter's `RuleBuilder<RuleName>` types the callback as
 * `($: GrammarSymbols<RuleName>, previous?: Rule) => RuleOrLiteral` — the
 * `previous`/`original` arg is loose `Rule` (no per-rule shape). The twin
 * narrows it to the rule's EXACT post-Enrich recursive shape, so a transform
 * callback's `original` is navigable and its path keys are checkable.
 *
 *   RecursiveRuleBuilder<S, K> = ($: GrammarSymbols<…>, p: EnrichRule<S['rules'][K]>) => RuleOrLiteral
 *
 * `$` is tree-sitter's own `GrammarSymbols<keyof S['rules'] & string>` — i.e.
 * `$.r` returns `SymbolRule<r>` (a leaf that composes in seq()/choice()), with
 * rule-name autocomplete + typo protection. We do NOT make `$.r` return the
 * recursive shape: a readonly recursive rule is not `RuleOrLiteral` (wouldn't
 * compose), and `$.foo` IS a symbol reference at tree-sitter runtime anyway.
 *
 * SYMBOL RESOLUTION is a SEPARATE, OPT-IN, DEPTH-BOUNDED op (`Resolve`), never
 * baked into `SymbolRule` or `$` — grammars are mutually recursive
 * (expression→binary_expression→expression…), so eager resolution is infinite
 * ("excessively deep"). `Resolve` expands one symbol to its rule body with a
 * tuple-length depth counter, capped small.
